API is a messenger between two programs — it takes requests and brings back responses.

**💬 What does “calling an API” mean?**
“Calling an API” just means asking another system for something.
Example:
Your weather app “calls a weather API” to ask,
“Hey, what’s the temperature in Delhi?”
**The API replies:**
“It’s 29°C and sunny 🌞”
That’s an API call — just a fancy word for asking data from another computer.
