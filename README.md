 # 3NEW_COURSE

This repository contains my backend learning journey from **Sangam Mukherjee**.
The course is divided into multiple long-duration parts (10–11 hours each),
and I am learning and implementing concepts step by step.

## 📁 Contents
Each folder represents what I learned in sequence, along with practice code and notes.

## 🛠 Backend Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS
- REST APIs
- Socket.IO (basic real-time application)

## 🗄 Database
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose

## 🧪 API Testing
**Postman**  
Used to test backend APIs without a frontend.
This simulates real-world backend development where APIs are tested independently.

## 📡 Real-Time Features
- Basic Socket.IO app
- User connection & disconnection handling
- Online users tracking
- Real-time message transfer

## 📝 Notes
Some personal notes may be ignored using `.gitignore` when not required.
