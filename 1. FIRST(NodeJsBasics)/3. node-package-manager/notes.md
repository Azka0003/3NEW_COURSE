“package.json defines dependencies and devDependencies with version ranges,
while package-lock.json records the exact installed versions like 8.1.3 to ensure consistent builds.”


✅ If version 8.1 is installed, what goes in package-lock.json?
package-lock.json stores the exact installed version.
If npm installs 8.1.0, then lock file will store 8.1.0 (not just 8.1).
👉 So lock file always contains the full exact version number.
📌 Example:
package.json → "express": "^8.1"
package-lock.json → "version": "8.1.3"


**📦 Which file contains devDependencies info?**
package.json contains devDependencies
Example: testing tools, nodemon, eslint
package-lock.json also records them, but:
It marks them as dev: true
Purpose: exact version locking
📌 So the main definition is in:
👉 package.json


package.json can be edited manually by developers.
package-lock.json is auto-generated by npm and should not be edited manually.

One similarity (bonus point):
Both files manage project dependencies in a Node.js application.



One-line difference (for viva):
package.json → What dependencies are needed
package-lock.json → Which exact versions are installed
