| GET    | To fetch data from server                         | Usually no body, parameters sent in URL         | `GET /users?age=20`                               |
| POST   | To send data to server (as data is crucial)       | Data sent in body (often JSON)                  | `POST /users` with `{ "name": "Azka" }`           |

| DELETE | To delete data                                    | Sometimes body or just URL                      | `DELETE /users/1`                                 |


✅ Summary:
res.send() works with POST, GET, PUT, DELETE — all.
res.json() is just a specialized version of send() for sending JSON data.


When I say “JSON data”, I mean data written in JSON format —
that’s just a way to represent structured information.

🧩 JSON means “JavaScript Object Notation”
It looks like JavaScript objects, but it’s really plain text.
Example of JSON data 👇
{
  "name": "Azka",
  "age": 20,
  "city": "Lucknow"
}
It’s just text — but it has key–value pairs (like a dictionary or object).

💡 Why it’s called “JSON data”
Because when we send or receive information between:
frontend ↔ backend
browser ↔ server
we often send it in JSON format (as text).
That’s why we say things like:
“The server received JSON data”
or
“The API returns JSON data”
So, when I say JSON data, I just mean:
“The structured text (key-value pairs) sent or received between client and server.”

🧩 JSON is not a JavaScript object.
It just looks like one — but technically, JSON is text (a string).
🧠 Think of it like this:
| Concept               | Type                  | Example                         | Notes                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **JavaScript Object** | actual in-memory data | `{ name: "Azka", age: 20 }`     | used inside your JS code      |
| **JSON**              | text (string)         | `'{"name": "Azka", "age": 20}'` | used for sending/storing data |


// ✅ JavaScript Object
const user = {
  name: "Azka",
  age: 20,
  city: "Lucknow"
};
✅ You can access its values directly:

console.log(user.name); // Azka
console.log(user.age);  // 20


🧩 2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
It looks similar, but it’s just text (a string) — not a real object.
// ✅ JSON
const jsonData = '{"name":"Azka","age":20,"city":"Lucknow"}';
❌ You can’t access its values directly:
console.log(jsonData.name); // undefined ❌




🧩 1. res.send()
Use res.send() when you want to send any kind of response —
text, HTML, or even objects.
Example:
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to our home page'); // sending text
});
It can also send an object, but Express will automatically convert it to JSON:
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: 'Azka', age: 20 }); // sends JSON automatically
});
So res.send() is flexible — it sends whatever you give it.

🧩 2. res.json()
Use res.json() when you specifically want to send JSON data
(i.e., a structured object or array).
Example:
app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
  const products = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Pen' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Notebook' }
  ];
  res.json(products); // sends JSON response
});
It automatically:
Converts your JS object → JSON text (JSON.stringify())
Sets the header Content-Type: application/json
So it’s more explicit and cleaner when you’re building APIs.


Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
